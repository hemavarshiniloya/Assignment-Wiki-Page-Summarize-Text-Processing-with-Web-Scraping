            "Several legends surround Alexanders birth and childhood According to the ancient Greek biographer Plutarch on the eve of the consummation of her marriage to Philip Olympias dreamed that her womb was struck by a thunderbolt that caused a flame to spread far and wide before dying away Sometime after the wedding Philip is said to have seen himself in a dream securing his wifes womb with a seal engraved with a lions image Plutarch offered a variety of interpretations for these dreams that Olympias was pregnant before her marriage indicated by the sealing of her womb or that Alexanders father was Zeus Ancient commentators were divided about whether the ambitious Olympias promulgated the story of Alexanders divine parentage variously claiming that she had told Alexander or that she dismissed the suggestion as impious\n",
